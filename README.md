## Predicting Obesity with Machine Learning
=========================

### Executive Summary

Obesity is a major health issue worldwide, driven by lifestyle, eating habits, and genetics. Catching it early can help prevent serious health problems, but predicting obesity risk isn't always straightforward. With machine learning and data analysis, we can pinpoint key risk factors and predict someone's likelihood of becoming obese. This gives people the chance to take action before it happens, making healthier choices based on data-driven insights.

- Analyzes factors like meal frequency, physical activity, caloric intake, and family history.

- Uses machine learning to classify individuals into different obesity risk categories.

- Provides insights into the most influential contributors to obesity.

- Enables proactive health interventions and personalized recommendations.
