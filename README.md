## Predicting Obesity with Machine Learning
=========================

### Executive Summary

Obesity is a major health issue worldwide, driven by lifestyle, eating habits, and genetics. Catching it early can help prevent serious health problems, but predicting obesity risk isn't always straightforward. With machine learning and data analysis, we can pinpoint key risk factors and predict someone's likelihood of becoming obese. This gives people the chance to take action before it happens, making healthier choices based on data-driven insights.

#### Who is Affected?

- Individuals who may be at risk of obesity.

- Healthcare providers looking to offer proactive care.

- Policymakers and researchers working on obesity prevention strategies.

#### Proposed Data Science Solution

Machine Learning Models: Classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks will be explored. The model will not only predict obesity risk but also explain which lifestyle changes could help reduce it.

#### Impact of the Solution

- Personalized health recommendations based on risk assessment.

- Healthcare applications where doctors and nutritionists can use the model to guide patients.

- Preventative strategies for meal planning services and fitness apps.
